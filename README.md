## Inspiration
When i was younger I had ScreenTime setup on my iPhone and sometimes it was very annoying. Years later after gaining some exprerience in computers and programming I decided to find a way how to extract the PIN from a phone. I was inspired by [this blog post](https://nbalkota.wordpress.com/2014/04/05/recover-your-forgotten-ios-7-restrictions-pin-code/) which undercovers how iOS was saving Salt + Target Key (the ingredients to the PIN) in the iPhone backup files and [PinFinder](https://github.com/gwatts/pinfinder) program.
